mother and father -> 2 kids
a flat in apartment is enough

==============================

disadvantages
============
maintaince on us
	electric
	plumbing
	security agency
costly
time taking

Flat
====
advantages
===
Less maintaince
	Electric
	Plumbing
	Security
Less cost
Time is also less

disadvantages
======
less privacy
shared space
not your design
rules

Individual PG
========
advantages
====
less cost
no maintaince
less time

disadvantages
=====
no privacy
everything is shared

HTML CSS JavaScript -> Frontend
Java or .NET -> Backend

J2EE -> Java Enterprise Edition
Servlets and JSP(Java Server pages) for viewing -> spring also depends on this
a single file -> frontend+backend
roboshop.war + dependencies(libraries) jar files
roboshop.ear (enterprise archeive)
150-200MB

A simple change in anything should again follow the release process

Client side BA -> Our BA
BA, Delivery Manager, Architects, Leads -> meeting
1 month
DEV SIT UAT PROD

9PM -> 6AM
Bridge -> L1 support, L2 support, L3 support(Developers) monitoring, service desk, client, managers

Seam framework(Jboss)
Struts
Spring (Evolution and Revolution)

Weblogic, Webspher, Jboss, Wildfly

Monolithic
=============
Frontend -> Backend(Entire app should be in single programming language)
API
.war
Apache tomcat, JBoss Web Server

Microservices
=============
Catalogue, Cart, Shipping
API
every component in diff programming language
MBs
Containers

sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo

sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y

a docker group is created
only root user and users inside docker group will have acess to docker cli

sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

exit and login again

docker ps -> all running containers

images

AMI = OS + System Packages + App run time + App code + App libraries -> Amazon machine image

Docker image = Bare minimum OS(10Mb) + System Packages + App run time + App code + App libraries -> Amazon machine image
500Mb

Image is static, Server is running version of OS

if you run image you get container(running instance of image)

docker ps -> running containers
docker pull nginx -> pulling the nginx image
docker images -> images in the local docker repo

docker pull + docker create ImageID + docker start ContainerID

docker run = docker pull + create + start
